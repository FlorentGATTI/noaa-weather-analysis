# Security Threat Model

## Overview

This document outlines potential security threats and mitigation strategies for the NOAA Weather Analysis platform.

## Asset Identification

1. Data Assets

   - NOAA weather data
   - User credentials
   - System configurations
   - Backup data
2. System Components

   - Frontend application
   - Backend API
   - Databases (HBase, Elasticsearch)
   - HDFS cluster
   - Authentication services

## Threat Categories

### 1. Data Access Threats

#### Unauthorized Data Access

- Threat: Unauthorized users accessing sensitive weather data
- Mitigation:
  - Kerberos authentication
  - Role-based access control
  - Data encryption at rest and in transit

#### Data Tampering

- Threat: Modification of weather data
- Mitigation:
  - Checksums for data integrity
  - Audit logging
  - Version control for data

### 2. Network Security

#### Man-in-the-Middle Attacks

- Threat: Interception of communications
- Mitigation:
  - SSL/TLS encryption
  - Certificate validation
  - Secure network configuration

#### DDoS Attacks

- Threat: Service availability compromise
- Mitigation:
  - Rate limiting
  - Load balancing
  - Traffic monitoring

### 3. Application Security

#### Injection Attacks

- Threat: SQL, NoSQL, or command injection
- Mitigation:
  - Input validation
  - Prepared statements
  - Escape special characters

#### Authentication Bypass

- Threat: Compromised authentication
- Mitigation:
  - Strong password policies
  - Multi-factor authentication
  - Session management

## Security Controls

### 1. Authentication

- Kerberos for service authentication
- JWT for API authentication
- SSL/TLS certificates

### 2. Authorization

- Role-based access control
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular access reviews

### 3. Monitoring

- Real-time security monitoring
- Audit logging
- Automated alerts

## Incident Response Plan

1. Detection

   - Monitor security alerts
   - Log analysis
   - System monitoring
2. Response

   - Incident classification
   - Containment procedures
   - Evidence collection
3. Recovery

   - System restoration
   - Data recovery
   - Root cause analysis

## Security Testing

- Regular penetration testing
- Vulnerability scanning
- Security code reviews
